# R for scientists

This is a website created to support a course I created, R for scientists. 
The course is aimed at researchers (PhD student or more senior), who currently run their statistical analyses in a program using point-and-click interface (such as SAS or SPSS) and who would like to learn R. 
As fun challenge for myself while creating this course, the course website is done entirely in RMarkdown.

There are a few versions of this course which I've used in different universities. 
This repo is for a course I ran for the Doctoral Programme in Food Chain and Health at Helsinki University in 2020.
The course website itself can be seen found at [https://jtsuvile.github.io/R_for_science/](https://jtsuvile.github.io/R_for_science/). 
This version of the course does not include links to the demo videos I've made, as those get shared in the course site handled by the university. 
If you'd also like access to the videos, you can look at the repo R_at_CSAN, which is a slightly updated version of this one as the course was run later in the year.
